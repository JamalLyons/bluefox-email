- I need to find out what type of json response data each endpoint returns 
so i can type that. I might have to do this manually but I want to ask the 
bluefox team first before that...

- allow the request re-try logic to be disabled by the user. They can pass 0 and a fetch will be made only once always.
- test the library using real emails.
- Make sure all return types are correct from bluefox
